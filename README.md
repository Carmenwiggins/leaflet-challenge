# leaflet-challenge

## Introduction 
In this project, we have to build an interactive dashboard using leaflet library to create a visualization on earthquake data .  The data was provided by the USGS.
Additionally, I had to include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked. Also, creating a legend that will provide context for the map data is part of the task.

We use D3.JS and Leaflet libraries to complete this challenge Aldo geojson
